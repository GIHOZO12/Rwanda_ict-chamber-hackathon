# Rwanda_ict-chamber-hackathon


 Overview
The Rwanda Citizen Engagement Portal is a digital platform designed to bridge the communication gap between Rwandan citizens and government agencies. This web application enables citizens to submit complaints about public services, track their resolution status, and receive official responses, while providing government agencies with tools to efficiently manage and respond to these complaints.


 As project how it works
 All people should be able to create their account 
 to access the system 
 then every government agence has their own password and agency code to enter in thier portal

 forexample for test you can use this : For  REG(Rwanda energy group)
 you can use agency code :192914
 and passowrd:ngewe001@
 you can use that to access the government agency 
 this will be the same to every agence how you will do that first you will create the account once you create
 an acoount you will go to home page look for button goverment agency once you clicked you will see form page and enter credentail above 
 you will you to agency dashbord where you have to manage it to process the response complaints come and everything for that agency

 and then whenyou want to send compaints onceyou login you will be profile and click on profileat right corner and goto citizen dashbord whre you will see how to send complaint baed on location you are and you will be able to choose category of your compaints then because you have credential for reg only because is only one i give you can select electricity on category so that it can be help you to see your compaint in agency i give access to
